# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.
#
# This workflow starts your API and fuzzes it with ForAllSecure Mayhem for API
# to find reliability, performance and security issues before they reach
# production.
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to:
#
# 1. Create a Mayhem for API account at
#    https://mayhem4api.forallsecure.com/signup
#
# 2. Create a service account token `mapi organization service-account create
#    <org-name> <service-account-name>`
#
# 3. Add the service account token as a secret in GitHub called "MAPI_TOKEN"
#
# 4. Update the "Start your API" step to run your API in the background before
#    starting the Mayhem for API scan, and update the `api-url` & `api-spec`
#    field.
#
# If you have any questions, please contact us at mayhem4api@forallsecure.com
